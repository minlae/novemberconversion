STEPS ON DEPLOYING SITE TO GH PAGES

// make sure gulp is running

// make your changes

// changes should include the removal of /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js inside of your .gitignore
	(because you want them to be ignored in the master branch. But you want them available in the deployment branch)

// quit gulp (cntrl c)

// add, commit, and push our changes to master branch
	MILENA'S NOTE: make sure to ONLY push the .gitignore changes to master branch (don't do the git add -A to add all files because then you will also add the files you were ignoring -_-)

// git checkout -b gh-pages (this creates a new branch called gh-pages)

// push our updated code from master branch into gh-pages by running the following command:
	git push origin gh-pages

// go back to your github repository for this project, navigate to settings, and under "GitHub Pages", you should see a link to your live site (this can take a while to propagate).

// in order to continue working on your master branch and further pushing code to this branch, use the following commands:
	git checkout master (this will take us back to our master branch)
		this branch is currently not ignoring our /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js
		// so now we have to RUN GULP
		// insert /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js back into the .gitignore
		// quit gulp
		// add, commit, and push these changes into our master branch
